Software Testing from the Ground Up: Kinds of Tests, Levels of Testing

Testing from the ground up is today regarded as the appropriate
approach to enterprise software development.  Write code.  Write a test for
 that code.  The reason is not just the case that the tests are, in and of
 themselves, valuable.  Some may have very, very low value, in fact. The
 real purpose of writing tests as you develop code is to improve the way
 you develop at all.

 If you test as you write you develop better coding habits; patterns emerge
 as a result of the continuous low-level refactoring that is often needed
  when you need to test an individual method; new, higher patterns emerge
  as a result of mid-level and service-level testing.  Some patterns such as
  dependency injection may at first seem like extra work but when you apply
  them to make a product testable you can suddenly find and prevent errors that
  unit tests are too fine to identify, and post-deployment or UI-driven tests
  are too slow, unreliable, and coarse-grained to implement in the needed detail
  (and be performant).

As a market-driven demonstration of this, a look at the most popular rapid-development
   frameworks such as Rails, Grails, and Play, there is deliberate encouragement of
   the use of testing from the ground up.  Grails, for example, allows a user to
   construct scaffolds with at least 1 and often 2 layers of tests (for but web
   controllers and domain objects, as well as services).

Gherkin and Cucumber: Using it at the High, Mid and Low Level

RT-Auto based tests can now be written in Gherkin

Mid-level test frameworks for Native-client, Flex Client,
core-server, and audio-server can use gherkin for mid-level

--------------------------------
What are the questions to ask during story development:
1) what components will be affected?
2) At what level can each affected component be tested for
    the change it will incur?

    Examples:
    The chairperson should be
    visually alerted with the number of participants who join,
    leave, and participate in an "equilizer" style graph on the
    native client (or the dash board?).  The refresh rate of this chart
    should be variable and should also track a line graph that
    should also display key events such as slide changes, video
    starts, stops and pauses.


    Purpose: this will allow a Chairperson to monitor the success (or
    more specifically observe the failure rate) of a conference
    as a factor of time.



So, the best pattern to approach for our new architectures is to
build the necessary frameworks as early as possible.
